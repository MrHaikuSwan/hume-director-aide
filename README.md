# Hume Director Aide

This is a prototype built to help performing group directors review recordings faster with empathic AI.

## Motivation

Reviewing long rehearsal recordings in detail while simultaneously remembering all of your notes is hard for directors to do, and typically requires lots of pausing and rewinding to find specific sections (source: personal experience). However, Hume's empathic AI automatically identifies key emotional moments with zero additional user input. Directors want to review key moments; this tool makes it easy to find those key moments.

## Current Failure Modes

This MVP reveals some failure modes of the current design and underlying technology:

- 48-dimensional emotions are difficult to project to a 1D linear scale
  - I basically guessed that "Joy" and "Confusion" would be good dimensions
- Emotions are highly variable between people
  - My grimace results in a high "Joy" score if I show my teeth
  - Musician "stank face" results in a high "Confusion" score
  - Someone else may use a different set of expressions entirely
- This design forces users to think about their face
  - The goal is for users to ignore the camera, but they won't

# Auto-Generated React Notes

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
